Sometimes an application may be missing essential documentation or contain details that need clarification. In these cases, you can seamlessly request additional information directly through the Slate platform.

## How to Request Document

1. **Open the Application File**\
   Navigate to the application that requires clarification or missing documentation.
2. **Trigger a Request for Information (RFI)**\
   Within the relevant section (e.g. VOI, Financials, Compliance), click **“Request Document”**.
3. **Add Commentary**\
   Clearly explain what is missing or unclear in the comment field as this will be visible to the applicant.
4. **Submit the Request**\
   Once submitted:
   - The applicant will receive an **email notification**
   - The document request will appear in their **dashboard task list**

## What Happens After Submission

- Once the applicant uploads the document, the **Compliance tab** is updated automatically
- The document is analysed by the **AI Copilot**, which will:
  - Validate formatting and policy alignment
  - Flag any issues or gaps
  - Update task statuses accordingly
