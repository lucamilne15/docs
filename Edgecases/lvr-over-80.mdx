</Note>

## Platform Action

Automatically escalated for human review.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Order manual valuation via ValX
- Update valuation and LVR in platform
- If LVR is revised to ≤ 80%, continue to formal approval if no other issues exist

## Example Situation

AVM returns a property value of $900,000 against a requested loan of $750,000. The system flags LVR at 83.3% and escalates. A manual valuation revises the value to $950,000, lowering LVR to 78.9% — now eligible.
