title: "Edgecase: Default in Last 12 Months"
---

<Note> This occurs when the applicant’s credit report shows a payment default recorded within the past 12 months.</Note>

## Platform Action

Auto-escalation to human.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Conduct a full review of the credit report to understand:
  - The **type and amount** of the default  
  - Whether the default has been **cleared or is outstanding**  
  - Any **supporting explanation** from the applicant
- Assess the overall application to determine if an exception is justified

## Example Situation

An applicant’s credit report lists a \$400 utility default from 6 months ago.  
The system auto-escalates. Credit ops confirm it was paid shortly after being listed and that no further credit issues are present. The case is approved with caution.
