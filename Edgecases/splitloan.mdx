<Note>
  This occurs when the applicant declares a split loan structure, such as fixed and variable components.
</Note>

## Platform Action

Escalates based on declared split.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Review all loan statements provided
- **<Tooltip tip="">Manually calculate combined loan amount</Tooltip>**<Tooltip tip="">, including:</Tooltip>
  - All split components
  - One month’s repayment buffer for each split
  - An additional \$1,500 buffer
- If only one statement is provided but multiple splits are declared:
  - Send a **"more information request"** to the applicant for the missing statements
  - Once received, reassess and calculate manually as above

## Example Situation

An applicant selects a split loan with \$300,000 fixed and \$200,000 variable components.

Only the fixed portion statement is provided. The system escalates the file.\
Credit ops requests the missing variable loan statement, calculates combined loan exposure, adds repayment and buffer amounts, and continues processing.
