title: "Edgecase: Payslips Are Not Consecutive or Are Outdated"
---

<Note>
  This occurs when the submitted income documentation is either missing sequential pay periods or is outside the acceptable date range.
</Note>

## Platform Action

- If detected **before submission**: system prompts the applicant to upload additional or updated payslips
- If detected **after submission**: auto-escalated to a human reviewer

### Credit Operations â€“ Next Steps

- Review submitted payslips for:
  - **Date gaps** or missing pay periods
  - **Outdated documentation** (typically older than 6 weeks)
- Request missing or updated documents as required
- Validate income consistency and stability before proceeding

## Example Situation

An applicant uploads payslips dated March 1 and April 12.\
The system detects a missing mid-March payslip and, since the application has already been submitted, escalates for human review.\
Credit ops requests the missing document and verifies the income timeline before progressing.
