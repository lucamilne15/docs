title: "Edgecase: Outgoing Mortgage Interest Rate >10%"
---

<Note>
  This occurs when the applicant declares an interest rate above 10% on their outgoing mortgage.
</Note>

## Platform Action

Auto-escalation to human.

### Credit Operations â€“ Next Steps

- Confirm whether the outgoing mortgage is:
  - A **private mortgage**, or
  - An **exceptional case** (e.g., temporary bridge loan, non-bank lender)
- If valid, proceed with full assessment; otherwise, flag for risk review

## Example Situation

An applicant declares a 10.5% interest rate on their current home loan.\
The platform auto-escalates. Credit ops confirm it's a private mortgage with a private lender and continue processing after validating repayment history.
