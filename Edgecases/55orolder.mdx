## Platform Action

Asks for an exit strategy letter and escalates to credit operations for review.

### Credit Operations â€“ Next Steps

- Confirm the exit strategy is plausible (e.g. downsizing, superannuation, sale of assets)
- Ensure supporting documentation is attached and meets policy standards

## Example Situation

A 58-year-old applicant applies for a 30-year loan term. The platform requests an exit strategy and escalates the application. The applicant provides a letter outlining plans to downsize at age 70 using projected superannuation assets.
