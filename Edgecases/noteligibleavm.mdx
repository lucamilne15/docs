title: "Edgecase: Not Eligible for AVM"
---

<Note>
  This occurs when the property does not meet Automated Valuation Model (AVM) eligibility criteria — typically when the Forecast Standard Deviation (FSD) is above tolerance.
</Note>

## Platform Action

Triggers an AVM policy check.\
Escalates to human if **FSD exceeds the acceptable threshold**.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Order a **manual valuation** via ValX or another approved provider
- **Update the LVR manually** in the platform once the valuation is received
- If the revised LVR is within acceptable limits, continue through to **formal approval**, subject to all other checks

## Example Situation

An AVM attempt on a rural property returns an FSD of 0.35, exceeding the max threshold of 0.25.\
The platform escalates the case.\
Credit ops orders a manual valuation, receives a compliant result, updates the LVR to 77%, and moves the application to the next stage.
