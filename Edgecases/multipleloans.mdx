title: "Edgecase: Multiple Current Home Loans"
---

<Note>This occurs when the applicant’s credit report or title search indicates more than one existing home loan.</Note>

## Platform Action

Auto-escalation to human.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Review all loan account information to:
  - **Validate if the data is accurate** (i.e. splits vs. separate loans)  
  - Identify any **short-term bridging loans** or refinancing overlaps  
  - Investigate potential **address mismatches** or joint liabilities
- Confirm total debt exposure before proceeding

## Example Situation

An applicant’s credit report shows two separate home loans.  
The platform escalates the file. Credit ops confirms one is a short-term bridging loan due to settle within weeks and verifies the total loan exposure is within policy. The application proceeds.
