Auto-escalation to human.

### Credit Operations â€“ Next Steps

- Review the **excluded postcode list**
- Determine next steps based on:
  - Specific policy restrictions for that postcode
  - Any exceptions or conditional approvals available

## Example Situation

An applicant enters a property address in postcode 4873 (Far North QLD).\
The system detects it's on the excluded list and escalates the file.\
Credit ops reviews the reason for exclusion (flood risk) and confirms ineligibility under current policy.
