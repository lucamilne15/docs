title: "Edgecase: Maximum LVR >80%"
---

<Note>
  This occurs when the Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) calculated from the AVM exceeds 80%. 
</Note>

## Platform Action

Auto-escalation to human.

### Credit Operations – Next Steps

- Order a **manual (non-AVM) valuation** via ValX
- Upon receipt, **upload the new valuation** to the Slate platform
- **Manually update the LVR**
- If updated LVR is ≤ 80%, proceed to **formal approval** (pending other checks)

## Example Situation

An applicant applies for a \$720,000 loan and the AVM estimates the property value at $850,000. The platform calculates an LVR of ~84.7% and escalates the case.\
Credit ops orders a manual valuation, which comes back at \$910,000, lowering LVR to ~79.1%. The application continues to approval.
